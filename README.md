Ancient greek helmets, originally made for playing on the Sktp_plagueisle map (which I recommend btw.) Their stats are those of the Norse helmet except for the NVG variant. That has the protection of a ballistic helmet and the NVG effect of the pumpkin helmet.

The bronze helmet is by emelyarules, CC-Atribution license, so as long as you credit her, you´re good to do whatever you want.

The black helmet is by Anthony Schmidt, CC-Attribution-NonCommercial, which means as long as you make no money from it and credit him, you´re good. It does however mean that one can´t monetize e.g. the NVG variant.
